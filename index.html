				<h1>Welcome to Budget Gamers</h1>
		
				<p>Hi, I'm Kaho Moon and I am a PC gamer on a tight budget. I have come across many budget 
					PC builds when I was building my PC and have gathered up adequate knowledge in PC building 
					and hope to be able to share some information with you. I will mainly focus on builds with 
					dedicated graphic cards (so we will not depends on integrated graphics) unless there is no 
					other options. In that case, I will share the best options you will have. 
					<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
				<h2> Disclaimer: The release of AMD Ryzen is due on early 2017. It promises more performcance with 40% less power. It might be worth it to wait until the release of Ryzen before building your PC because they might release a budget CPU and if not, it will still drop the prices of other CPU as people will be switching over.
