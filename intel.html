<h2> The $300 Intel Build</h2>
							<p>The CPU will be a Pentium G3258 which is a dual core CPU with no hyper threading or turbo boost. It is your typical generic CPU... with on trick up
							its sleeves, it is unlocked. The stock frequency on this CPU is 3.2 Ghz, but it can be overclocked to 4, 4.5, or even 4.7 Ghz on the stock heatsink, meaning you won't
							have to spend even more for more performance.
							The motherboard will be the MSI H81-M P33 motherboard sporting the 1150 socket. It supports ddr3 and overclocking in addition to its low price of around $44, which is what we need it for. Other than that, there is nothing else to brag about on this motherboard, it is generic, but does its job.
							The graphics card is the gtx 1050 non-ti version. It is the newest budget gpu released from NVIDIA, even betting the competition from AMD, rx 460, by around 10-15% for
							the exact same price, even cheaper in some instances. The card retails for around $109-$130, depending on what other features is on the specific crd you purchase. You can get the ti variant of the card for around $140 if you have more to spend. The ti variant has around 20-30% more performance and is slightly better than NVIDIA's last generation gpu gtx 960.</p>
