						<h2> The $300 Intel Build</h2>
						<li> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KAbpUr9sL.jpg" height="150" width="150"><br />The CPU will be a Pentium G3258 which is a dual core CPU with no hyper threading or turbo boost. It is your typical generic CPU... with on trick up
							its sleeves, it is unlocked. The stock frequency on this CPU is 3.2 Ghz, but it can be overclocked to 4, 4.5, or even 4.7 Ghz on the stock heatsink, meaning you won't
							have to spend even more for more performance.</li>

It supports ddr3 and overclocking in addition to its low price of around $44, which is what we need it for. Other than that, there is nothing else to brag about on this motherboard, it is generic, but does its job.
